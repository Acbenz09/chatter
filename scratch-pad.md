I am building a chat app using React, TS, React Query frontend and Hono, TS, Prisma backend running on Bun runtime. Also using Better auth as authentication library and thinking of using socket.io for realtime chat feature.

Here are the features I want,

    - Realtime chat
    - Both 1v1 chat and group chat
    - One can create group
    - If one is online must show online status
    - In group chat one admin, the one who created group can remove member from group
    - one can join group through group code
    - admin must allow the join request to the group
    - users have username so groups must have a unique username

So if you understand what i wanna do just say yes. These are my requirements for now might add more later. I will tell you next what to do.
